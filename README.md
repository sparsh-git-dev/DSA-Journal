# DSA-Journal
This repository documents my journey of solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, primarily from LeetCode.
Welcome to my curated DSA practice repository. Here I document my problem-solving journey with:
- âœ… Problem links
- âœ… Final solution codes
- âœ… Detailed solution notes (approach, complexity, edge cases)

For each problem, you'll find:

ðŸ“Œ Problem Link (to the original LeetCode problem)

ðŸ“„ My Code Solution (Java/Dart)

ðŸ§  Detailed Notes (Approach, Edge Cases, Time and Space Complexity Analysis)

Folder Structure: Problems are organized by topics like Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, etc., for easy navigation.

ðŸ“ˆ Purpose
Master core DSA concepts.
Build a strong foundation for coding interviews.
Share clean, understandable, and optimized solutions with the community.
Help recruiters and developers understand my problem-solving process, not just the final answer.
